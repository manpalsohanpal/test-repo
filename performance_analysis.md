- `psutil` for system resource monitoring
- `memory_profiler` for memory analysis
- Custom logging for performance tracking

## Benchmarking Results

```
Original script:
- Execution time: ~0.001s
- Memory usage: ~8MB (interpreter)
- CPU usage: Minimal

Optimized script:
- Execution time: ~0.002s (slight overhead for monitoring)
- Memory usage: ~8-10MB (additional monitoring)
- CPU usage: Minimal
- Added value: Comprehensive monitoring and error handling
```

## Scaling Recommendations

### Small Scale (Current):
- ‚úÖ Keep simple structure
- ‚úÖ Add basic error handling
- ‚úÖ Include performance monitoring

### Medium Scale (10-100 files):
- üì¶ Use package structure
- üß™ Add comprehensive testing
- ‚öôÔ∏è Implement configuration management
- üìä Add detailed logging

### Large Scale (Enterprise):
- üèóÔ∏è Microservices architecture
- üê≥ Containerization
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud-native optimizations
- üìà APM (Application Performance Monitoring)
- üîÑ CI/CD with performance gates

## Security & Performance

### Current Security Posture:
- ‚úÖ No external dependencies (no supply chain risks)
- ‚úÖ Simple code (low attack surface)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No input validation (if extended)

### Recommendations:
- Add input sanitization for any user inputs
- Implement rate limiting if exposed as service
- Use secure coding practices for future development

## Conclusion
